          <p>
            If you decide to share, your data will be end-to-end encrypted with
            AES256-GCM before it's uploaded. Since the encryption key is
            generated on your device, nobody but you can access it, not even us.{" "}

          <p>
            On top of the highest e2e encryption standard, your medical data is
            always anonymized before being uploaded, so even if the data gets
            compromised, it's impossible to trace it back to an specific person,
            time or location.
