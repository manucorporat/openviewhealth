## How does it work?

### üåê Open source, open data

Open View Health is open source app licensed under the MIT license.
Medical data donated to the platform also becomes part of truly
public dataset, available to anyone interested.


### üôà Privacy-aware

All data remains offline without ever leaving your computer and we
never track users.


### üîí End-to-end encrypted

If you decide to share, your data will be end-to-end encrypted with
AES256-GCM before it's uploaded. Since the encryption key is
generated on your device, nobody but you can access it, not even us.

### üë§ HIPPA Compliant Anonymization

On top of the highest e2e encryption standard, your medical data is
always anonymized before being uploaded, so even if the data gets
compromised, it's impossible to trace it back to an specific person,
time or location.

Names, locations, dates, annotations, all metadata is removed
following the strictest guidelines of the
[HIPAA Privacy Rule's De-Identification Standard](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/privacy/special-topics/de-identification/index.html)
